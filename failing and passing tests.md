## Analysis

**Strong Areas:**
- All contract tests are passing (47/47), indicating solid API contract compliance
- User management and expense management integration tests are fully passing
- Authentication middleware appears to be working correctly for most scenarios

**Areas Needing Attention:**
- Activity logging functionality is not implemented
- Group management endpoints are returning 404s instead of expected responses
- Balance calculation has multiple issues with data format expectations
- Some authentication verification responses don't match expected format

**Next Steps:**
- Implement activity logging service and endpoints
- Fix group management API endpoints
- Update balance calculation to match expected response formats
- Align authentication response formats with test expectations

# Future Improvements: Critical Technical Debt

This document tracks critical improvements identified during code reviews that should be addressed in future iterations.

## 1. Input Sanitization

**Problem:** Current API endpoints lack proper input validation and sanitization.

**Why Important:**
- Security vulnerability: Potential XSS attacks through unsanitized inputs
- Data integrity: Malformed or malicious data could corrupt the database
- User experience: Better error messages and validation feedback
- Compliance: Helps meet security standards and best practices

**Impact:** High security risk, affects all user-facing endpoints

## 2. Resource Management

**Problem:** Each service creates its own database connection instance.

**Why Important:**
- Performance degradation: Multiple connections per request waste resources
- Connection pool exhaustion: Can lead to database connection limits being hit
- Resource leaks: Improper connection lifecycle management
- Scalability issues: Difficult to optimize database usage under load
- Testing complexity: Hard to mock or control database connections in tests

**Impact:** High performance and reliability risk, affects all database operations

## 3. Dependency Injection

**Problem:** Services are instantiated with hardcoded dependencies at module level.

**Why Important:**
- Testability: Hard to mock dependencies for unit testing
- Maintainability: Tight coupling makes code changes more risky
- Flexibility: Difficult to swap implementations or configurations
- Code reusability: Services can't be easily reused with different dependencies
- Separation of concerns: Business logic mixed with dependency management

**Impact:** Medium maintainability issue, affects development velocity and code quality

## Implementation Priorities

1. **Phase 1 (Immediate - Security First):** Input sanitization
2. **Phase 2 (Performance Critical):** Resource management
3. **Phase 3 (Architectural Improvement):** Dependency injection

## Related Issues

- Performance bottlenecks under concurrent load
- Security vulnerabilities from user inputs
- Difficulty writing comprehensive unit tests
- Code duplication in service instantiation patterns
- Scalability limitations for future growth
